__CARLA XR DOCUMENTATION__

This project is part of the greater effort of the Drive Right Project held collectivelly by the University of Pennsylvania and Carnegie Mellon University, and the purpose is for the safe autonomous vehicle education, demonstration, and development.

The project adopts the open-source [CARLA](https://carla.org/) driving simulator and converts it into the Virtual Reality framework in the first person driver's view.
It also adds a self-powered G29 steering wheel for manual vehicle control and autonomous mode interaction. Our generic implementation provides an easy-to-follow instrusction set, and allows the VR rendering to be done on any headset.
